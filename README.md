# svd2nim

Convert [ARM CMSIS-SVD](https://arm-software.github.io/CMSIS_5/SVD/html/index.html) files to Nim register memory mappings.

svd2nim is a tool that generates Nim modules providing access to microcontroller
peripheral registers. This is a low-level building block used for writing
peripheral drivers in Nim.  Therefore, svd2nim is similar to
[svd2rust](https://github.com/rust-embedded/svd2rust) (Rust),
[regz](https://github.com/ZigEmbeddedGroup/regz) (Zig) and [ARM Devtools
svdconv](https://github.com/Open-CMSIS-Pack/devtools) (C).

## Goals

* Conform to the CMSIS-SVD spec in order to be compatible with all Cortex-M
  devices, given that the SVD file is conforming.

* Provide a high-performance yet type-safe API for low level register access.

This project also aims to provide Nim bindings for CMSIS `core_*.h` headers,
which provide access to peripherals that are common to a given Cortex-M core,
such as the NVIC (interrupt controller) and the SysTick timer.

## Building

Install Nim and Nimble: see https://nim-lang.org/install.html. Then,

```bash
git clone https://github.com/auxym/svd2nim
cd svd2nim
nimble install -d
nimble build
```

The svd2nim binary will be created in the `./build` subdirectory.

## API

The Nim module generated by svd2nim tries to stay close to CMSIS conventions
when it makes sense to do so. However, Nim does not map 1:1 to C (in particular,
for marking struct members `volatile` or `const`, and for anonymous unions),
therefore the API is not identical to CMSIS C `device.h` headers.

The Nim API has was designeed with two main goals:

1. As close as possible to zero performance cost for accessing registers,
   compared to using C headers directly.

2. Use Nim's type system to provide as much safety as possible while still
   respecting goal #1.

The examples below are taken from the Nim module generated from the
`ATSAMD21G18A.svd` file found under the `tests` folder of the repository.

### Peripheral Objects

For each peripheral, a `const` object is defined, each member is either a
register or cluster (a container type for other registers).

```nim
const GCLK* = GCLK_Type(
  CTRL: GCLK_CTRL_Type(loc: 0x40000c00),
  STATUS: GCLK_STATUS_Type(loc: 0x40000c01),
  CLKCTRL: GCLK_CLKCTRL_Type(loc: 0x40000c02),
  GENCTRL: GCLK_GENCTRL_Type(loc: 0x40000c04),
  GENDIV: GCLK_GENDIV_Type(loc: 0x40000c08),
)
```

Note that all fields are marked public.

Cluster objects are similar to Peripherals: they are "container" objects that
contain either registers or other clusters. svd2nim supports clusters nested arbitrarily deep.

Registers are also `object` types. However, registers contain a
single field, which is the address (`loc`) to the memory-mapped register,
represented as `uint`. Example:

```nim
type GCLK_GENDIV_Type = object
  loc: uint
```

Note that the `loc` field is *private*. Indeed, registers are only intended to
be accessed using accessor templates described in the following section. This
allows:

* Using Nim's type system to enforce register access (read-only, write-only,
  read/write) permissions specified in the SVD file.

* Automatically calling `volatileLoad` and `volatileStore` calls for reads
  and writes.

* Convenient access to bitfields, also described below.

### Accessors

As noted above, registers can only be read or written using generated accessor
procs. For each register object type, either a `read` proc, a
`write` proc, or both may be generated, depeding on the register access
permissions defined by the SVD file. Example (for a read/write register):

```nim
proc read*(reg: ADC_WINLT_Type): uint16 {.inline.} =
  volatileLoad(cast[ptr uint16](reg.loc))

proc write*(reg: ADC_WINLT_Type, val: uint16) {.inline.} =
  volatileStore(cast[ptr uint16](reg.loc), val)
```

### Bitfields

SVD registers may define `field` elements, which means that the register value
is split into bitfields. For these registers, svd2nim generates a distinct
integer type which is used as the register value type (for `read`/`write`)
instead of the base integer type. Example:

```nim
type
  # (...)
  GCLK_GENDIV_Fields* = distinct uint32
```

Each bitfield of the distinct type can be read or set using bitfield accessors.
Here, the `GCLK_GENDIV` register defines 2 fields: `ID` (bits 0-3) and `DIV`
(bits 8-23). Other bits are unused (reserved). The accessors generated are:

```nim
func ID*(r: GCLK_GENDIV_Fields): uint32 {.inline.} =
  r.uint32.bitsliced(0 .. 3)

proc `ID=`*(r: var GCLK_GENDIV_Fields, val: uint32) {.inline.} =
  var tmp = r.uint32
  tmp.clearMask(0 .. 3)
  tmp.setMask((val shl 0).masked(0 .. 3))
  r = tmp.GCLK_GENDIV_Fields

# Note: `div` is a reserved keyword in Nim, so DIVx is used
# to avoid the conflict.
func DIVx*(r: GCLK_GENDIV_Fields): uint32 {.inline.} =
  r.uint32.bitsliced(8 .. 23)

proc `DIVx=`*(r: var GCLK_GENDIV_Fields, val: uint32) {.inline.} =
  var tmp = r.uint32
  tmp.clearMask(8 .. 23)
  tmp.setMask((val shl 8).masked(8 .. 23))
  r = tmp.GCLK_GENDIV_Fields
```

Credit goes to the
[cdecl/bitfields](https://elcritch.github.io/cdecl/cdecl/bitfields.html)
library, which strongly inspired this approach to handling bitfields, due to
[issues](https://lwn.net/Articles/478657/) with "native" C bitfields.

svd2nim generates *two* `write` accessors for registers that are writable and
define fields. One takes a full value (the distinct integer type) and the second
takes a separate value for each field, with a default value equal to the
register's reset value for that field as defined by the SVD. Example:

```nim
proc write*(reg: GCLK_GENDIV_Type, val: GCLK_GENDIV_Fields) {.inline.} =
  volatileStore(cast[ptr GCLK_GENDIV_Fields](reg.loc), val)

proc write*(reg: GCLK_GENDIV_Type, ID: uint32 = 0, DIVx: uint32 = 0) =
  var x: uint32
  x.setMask((ID shl 0).masked(0 .. 3))
  x.setMask((DIVx shl 8).masked(8 .. 23))
  reg.write x.GCLK_GENDIV_Fields
```

Finally, for convenience when doing a read-modify-write operation, a `modifyIt`
template is also generated for read-write registers with fields. Similarly to
the the `*it` templates in Nim's `std/sequtils` module, `modifyIt` reads the
register and stores its value in the `it` variable. The `op` parameter passed to
the template can then modify `it`. Finally, `it` is written back to the
register. Example template code:

```nim
template modifyIt*(reg: GCLK_GENDIV_Type, op: untyped): untyped =
  block:
    var it {.inject.} = reg.read()
    op
    reg.write(it)
```

This allows modifying mutliple fields with a **single read-modify-write
operation**.

**IMPORTANT NOTE**: [Due to a currently open Nim
bug](https://github.com/nim-lang/Nim/issues/14623) related to `volatileStore`
and `volatileLoad`, calling `modifyIt` from the top-level in a module results in
incorrect codegen by the Nim compiler and in C compiler errors. The workaround
is simple: ensure that all calls are made from inside a `proc`.

See further below for usage examples of the accessor templates.


### Example Usage

Below is small usage example, inspired by [Thea Flowers's blog post on the
SAMD21 clock system](https://blog.thea.codes/understanding-the-sam-d21-clocks/).

Larger examples:
  * [The complete code to enable the 48 MHz DFLL clock on SAMD21](https://github.com/auxym/nim-on-samd21/blob/master/src/clocks.nim)

  * [SAMD21 GPIO driver leveraging macros](https://github.com/auxym/nim-on-samd21/blob/master/src/clocks.nim)

```nim
import atsamd21g18a

# register access is wrapped in a proc due to https://github.com/nim-lang/Nim/issues/14623

proc initDfll48m*() =
# Set the correct number of wait states for 48 MHz @ 3.3v */
  NVMCTRL.CTRLB.modifyIt:
    it.RWS = HALF

  # Enable external 32K crystal oscillator.
  # Note: Explicitly set ONDEMAND=false because the argument default is true
  SYSCTRL.XOSC32K.write(
    XTALEN=true, STARTUP=0x7, EN32K=true, ONDEMAND=false
  )

  # This has to be a separate write as per datasheet section 17.6.3
  SYSCTRL.XOSC32K.modifyIt:
    it.ENABLE = true

  # Wait for the external crystal to be ready
  # Read the PCLKSR register and get the XORSC32KRDY bitfield from its value
  while not SYSCTRL.PCLKSR.read().XOSC32KRDY: discard
```

### Core header bindings

The "core" C header file for a given ARM Cortex-M CPU  (eg, `core_cm0plus.h`
for Cortex-M0+) contains functions related to peripherals that are common to
the CPU core, such as the NVIC (interrupt controller) and the SysTick Timer.

When `svd2nim` is called with the `--include-core` option, a second file,
containing bindings for the core header, will be generated in the same output
directory as the main device module (eg.  core_cm0plus.nim). This Nim file is
`include`d in the main device module (and cannot de used standalone, as it
depends on many things in the device module). This means that when
`--include-core` is used, the resulting Nim module requires that the
corresponding C headers can be found by the C compiler (eg. by passing
`--passC:-I./lib/CMSIS/Core/Include` to the Nim compiler). The CMSIS headers can
be obtained from:

https://github.com/ARM-software/CMSIS_5/tree/develop/CMSIS/Core/Include

And are documented here:
https://arm-software.github.io/CMSIS_5/Core/html/modules.html

See the nim-on-samd21 repository, linked in the examples section above, for an
example on building the Nim core bindings against the CMSIS C headers.

 Currently only the `core_cm0plus.nim` module, for Cortex-M0+ CPUs, is provided
 by svd2nim , but PRs are welcome for others.
